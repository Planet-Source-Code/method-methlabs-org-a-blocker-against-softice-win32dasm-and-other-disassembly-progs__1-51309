## A Blocker Against SoftIce, Win32Dasm and Other Disassembly Progs


</div>

### Description

This code attempts to detect and disable the following:

(If it can't disable, it'll just quit)

Win32Dasm, Debuggy, OllyDBG, ProcDump, SoftSnoop, TimeFix, TMR Ripper Studio, Regmon and Filemon.

It also attempts to add protection against other step-debugging applications. (TimeFix-kill used before this check too!!)
 
### More Info
 
The code is sloppy as I am yet to establish the actual size of applications running and I'm not exactly a methodical coder!!! - I'm very unorthodox to say the least (tried to comment throughout though). However, These routines do seem to be quite effective against the programs I've tried. I'll post an update in the near future... It'll check itself to make sure it's not been modified!! ;)
